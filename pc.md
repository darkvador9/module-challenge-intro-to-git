## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? an Open Source Distributed Version Control System. 

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is an Open Source Distributed Version Control System and Github is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based git hosting service.

3. Why do we create a branch?  Because it isolates your work from other team members and different branches can be merged into any one branch as long as they belong to the same repository.

4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? Used to update the local version of a repository from a remote.

5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. Git switch.

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? The 'git fetch' command downloads, commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo. The 'git merge' command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch. The 'git pull' command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.


7. What is a merge conflict? An event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.

8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? Open the conflicted file and make any necessary changes. After editing the file, use the git add command to stage the new merged content. The final step is to create a new commit with the help of the git commit command.
